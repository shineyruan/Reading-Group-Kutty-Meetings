# Prediction Market

Prediction market is a mechanism that aggregates people's beliefs to predict a future event. It is somehow similar to machine learning, but it learns information from people rather than experiences.

Given a random event `X`, how can we attact people to come and tell us something about its probability distribution?

## Scoring Rules

Scoring rules are the simplest type of prediction mechanism. It simply assigns each incoming agent a score according to the relevance of his/her information with the actual outcome. Usually a payoff is sent to the agent for his/her information.

## Cost-function based Prediction Market

With scoring rules we can establish a market where people can trade on some designated commodities (e.g., stock, contracts, securities, etc). We aim to encourage people to reveal their true information about the random event `X` as they trade.
